# Overcoming-Class-Imbalance-in-Alzheimer-s-Diagnosis-A-Novel-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-Framework
Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis is critical but often hindered by class imbalance and limited data in medical imaging. This study introduces a hybrid ResNet50+U-Net model, combining ResNet50 for feature extraction and U-Net-inspired decoders for spatial detail recovery.

To address these challenges, this research aims to:
1)Develop a novel hybrid model that integrates
ResNet50 and U-Net to enhance robustness and
effectively predict all Alzheimer's stages, even
in the presence of class imbalance and limited
data for certain categories. 2)Compare the proposed hybrid model against the
standalone ResNet50 architecture, highlighting
the former's superior performance in terms of
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and its
ability to handle imbalanced data effectively..
